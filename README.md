# academic-hotels

*Like every project starting with "academic-", this was an exercise of a course I'm taking right now or I took before because it finished.*

This application shows a list of hotels of South America and leaves the user the ability of filtering them by date (from/to), country, price and hotel size (this last one doesn't make any sense because who wants to consider the size of the hotel instead of the size of the room he/she is going to stay in).
